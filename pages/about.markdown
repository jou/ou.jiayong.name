Hi there, my name's Jiayong Ou (区家勇 in Chinese; Ou/区 is my last name), a twenty-something web developer currently working for [those guys][employer].

 [employer]: http://www.ymc.ch/
 
As you might have suspected from my name, I'm Chinese, from [Shunde][wp-shunde] ([map][map-shunde]), [Guangdong province][wp-gd]. I pretty much grew up in Switzerland (and holding a Swiss passport since a few years ago). In addition to German, which I consider my native language, I speak English and Chinese. While I pretty much completely forgot how to write in Chinese, I can still speak [Cantonese][wp-cantonese] and a bit of [Mandarin][wp-mandarin].
