title: Hi Jekyll!

Finally arrived on the [jekyll][] bandwagon and got around re-launching <http://ou.jiayong.name> with it. I've got to say it's been very nice to work with. In case you don't know jekyll: It's a Ruby gem that generates static pages from a bunch of files containing its layouts, contents and assets. Everything you see here are static pages.

This blog is intended to supplement my [tumblr blog][orly.ch] with a low noise, original content one. It focuses on software development, although I might put an off-topic post here every now and then. For the beginning, I've dragged some of my older posts with useful infos in it over.
